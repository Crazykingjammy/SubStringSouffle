# SubStringSouffle
 The CMake Version of Sub String Homework task. 
 
 This is the homework assignment.

Given a large text file (allwords.txt) containing a single word on each line,for each value find and output all substrings matching words from a second text file in the same format (commonwords.txt). These files can be found in the attached zip file (homework_data.zip).

Output should be in the same order as the primary input file (allwords.txt), with the substring matches presented in alphabetical order, e.g.:

that: at, hat

Your solution to the assignment should be implemented in C/C++, but beyond this you are free to use whatever supplemental libraries and techniques you feel will best help you solve the problem. We will primarily be looking at how you approach a solution, so there is no definitive right or wrong answer, but you should consider structure, correctness, clarity, readability and performance.




### Project Notes

Here is a small dump of the type of things i am learning with this project, not sure where ot dump the notes. This read me seems more fun than a one note file.
Reference all my material here while I work on this project.
Perhaps the wiki is more suitable?

#### gcc compile arguments


 gcc -o hello c_helloworld.cpp -lstdc++
 
 This seems to be a regular -lstd++ compile.
 
 clang++ -o program program.cpp
g++ -std=c++11 -o program program.cpp
g++-7 -std=c++11 -o program program.cpp
./program   (runs the program)
 
 Fun C++11 type stuff. Havent tried C++14. 
 
 All these arguments are used because I decided to use fancy new for loops to be more lazy while typing loops. lol.
